# 11/14

Debating how to handle the User. At first I thought of doing it as a microservice, but I think I am unnecessarily complicating things for this project if I want to protect the endpoints in the monolith.

# 11/15

Spent some time exploring Auth0. Ran into a few problems that were taking too long

# 11/20

Worked on React setup, basic folder structure and the routes for all the pages

# 11/21

Today I will create the landing page and the style wrapper for the entire project. If I finish that before noon, I will code out the user list page

# 11/27

Coding out the order details page today. Also examined the backend to see about protecting the routes, which can probably just be done by sending the token from the frontend

# 11/29

Lots of bug fixes today, added a dedicated page for the login rather than having it on the home page

# 12/4

Working on the frontend review functionality. Will then work on the square implementation.

# 12/11

Working on the Readme. I have finished all of the functionality I care to do right now.
